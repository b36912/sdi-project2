Story 

/*
On a beautiful summer morning, the Davis Family starts a two-day journey on the road from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 
to Houston, Texas. If they drive non-stop it will take them 25 hours to get to Houston. If not it can take them almost 
or equal to 48 hours to arrive in Houston. 

After driving for 5 hours, Junior said, “I’m hungry, can we get something to eat?” Dad responded, “Of course we can.” 

Knowing what’s in the area of Virginia they’re in, the family tells Senior what they wants for lunch. The daughter and 
son wanted Chick Fi La. Dad and Mom wants Panera Bread.  The daughter wants a chicken sandwich and lemonade. The son 
wants chicken nuggets, french-fries, and a lemonade. Tinasha wants a chicken panini sandwich with a water, and an apple. 
Senior wants a turkey panini sandwich with kettle chips and a water.  The children’s meals cost $6.25 each. 
The parent’s meals cost $8.00 each. 

After getting their meals they got back on the road to Houston. 5 hours later in South Carolina, the family starts to 
get tired and sleepy.  If the next Exit has hotel pictures on it, he will take that exit. If not he will continue 
driving until he sees an Exit with hotel pictures. Once he takes the Exit, he goes to the hotels to see how much it 
cost. If it cost more than $130 to stay for the night, he will go to another hotel until he finds one that cost a $130 
or less. 

Comfort Inns cost $128 to stay for the night, so the dad said, “Great!”

After sleeping for 8 hours the family got back on the road to continue to Houston. They eventually arrived to Houston 
after leaving Philadelphia 36 hours ago.
