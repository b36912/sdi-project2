<p>The following paragraph is my story for the class to read. I chose this fictional story because i felt it was easy for me to expand on.</p>

<p>One beautiful summer evening, the Davis family was in the middle of driving from Philadelphia, PA to Houston, TX.
They've been on the road 10 hours and are exhausted.
Somewhere in Georgia, the Dad decided to find a hotel to stay at for the night.
He said if the next exit sign coming up has a hotel advertised the family will go there first, else they will drive until they do.
Once they got to the hotel the dad went into the hotel to see if they had any vacancies and if so how much was it going cost for a non smoking room with 2 beds.
The hotel clerk told him that they do have vacancies and that that for a non smoking room with 2 beds will cost  $119.99 before tax.  T
he dad checked his wallet to see if he had enough, he responded to the clerk, "Sold!"
The clerk said, "Great! I'll put you in our system." The clerk then said, "After taxes the total is $128.00.
